title: District report
params:
  area: Medway

* This is a basic Rmd (R markdown) file.
* At the top we have a YAML section. 
* This YAML section contains a `params` reference and below it there is an indented `area` reference
* These parameters are used by Knit to create a simple interface 
* If we "knit with parameters" we will be asked to specify an area, with Medway as the default

* Below we have an R chunk with no code


```{r}



```
