* Now we will start to build our district profile. 
* To begin with we get data from Public Health England's wonderful [fingtertips website](https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/) using the fingertipsR package
* Each indicator in fingtertips has an ID. The ID for life expectancy at birth is [90366](https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/search/90366)
* Data are available for different geographies. AreaTypeID 101 is for districts.
* For now we are just going to look at the first 6 rows


```{r}

x <- fingertips_data(90366, AreaTypeID = 101)

head(x)
```
